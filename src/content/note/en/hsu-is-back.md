## Looking Back on My Life on the Internet

If I were to trace it back, it probably began in high school — when I used to write blogs and stories, 
and sometimes, just bits and pieces of my daily life online. Words were like a mirror, reflecting the self that had yet to grow up.

Then, one quiet afternoon two years ago, the server expired — and I forgot to renew it. A simple story.
All those years of writing, emotions, and photos sank into the void together.

I wasn't too sad.

Or rather, hidden in that disappearance was a faint sense of relief.
After all, for a mild perfectionist, maintaining an imperfect version of oneself has never been easy.

Now, two years later, I'm back again.

This time, I hope it will stay with me until the day I finish my PhD.

As for why — maybe it's because I've started to feel again that **"life is actually kind of fun."**
(Or, to be honest, maybe I've just relapsed into my literary youth phase.)

Or maybe, I just want to leave something behind in the cracks of time — even if it's only faint traces.

My love once posted something that said:

> You asked why I like taking photos with the original camera app.
> I guess keeping people or moments as they are feels more important (or maybe I'm just lazy).
> When I open my album and see faces or scenes that look just like in my memory, I start to miss the past.

To me, the life I have now is exactly what I never want to forget.

It doesn't have some grand meaning — it's simply a part of my life.
And I think, this time, I have to leave something behind for it.
