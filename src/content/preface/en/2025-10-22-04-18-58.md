So-called “sincerity” is, perhaps, a gentle kind of cunning.
As if loving you “enough” could cover every crack—
especially those made by money and reality.
I’m not here to preach consumerism;
I only mean that sincerity holds a trace of meaning
only when two people truly love each other.
If one can give nothing and says, “I give you my heart,”
then such a heart feels far too fragile,
almost vanishing in the quiet of its own honesty.
