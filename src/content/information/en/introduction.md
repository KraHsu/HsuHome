**KraHsu’s Blog (The Nest of KraHsu)** is a small personal corner of the internet created by KraHsu, where I record my thoughts and musings from learning, life, and research.

As for me, I’m currently a Ph.D. student in Automation at Beijing Institute of Technology. My research focuses on embodied intelligence. In my spare time, I enjoy programming, writing, and spending time with my partner.

This site shares my creations and stories — from tools and articles to everyday moments with my loved one. I hope it can bring you a little warmth too (\*^▽^\*).
